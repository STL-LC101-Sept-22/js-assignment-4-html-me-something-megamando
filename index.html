      <h1>My Journey as a Tattoo Enthusiast</h1>
     <header><em>From the perspective of Lando Cook.</em></header>
    <main class="indentstart">
        <p>It was only recently that I figured out, that around 7 years old or so, Allen Iverson was the first person that brought to my attention how much I like tattoos. He was the star Guard of the Philadelphia Seventy-Sixers, and he was everything I wanted to be in a basketball player. Iverson was only 6ft tall, had the flashiest handle in the sport - simultaneously making defenders look both silly and incapable, and is the single-handed reason for the first ever NBA dress code. As a second grader, I knew I was going to be a tattooed person. By age 17, I was begging my mom to take me to the local tattoo shop to celebrate my high school graduation - any excuse I could leverage to get my first introduction to the world I wanted so badly to join. Of course, I'd need her permission, which I wasn't so sure I'd receive. Since my older brother already had a couple, she caved and took me, and I could hardly contain my excitement.</p>
       <p>I knew it would hurt - they're drawing with needles after all, but my brother assured me that getting a shoulder piece would be something I could sit through. I took his advice and a year later I was getting my collarbone done. My first few pieces of artwork were proudly collected and stored away beneath my clothing. Once I was ready to be more bold about my infatuation with the tattoo scene, I tactfully inched my way down my forearms, as not to tip off my parents and expose my plan for what was to come next. With every new area inked, comes its own specific brand of pain. I've come to expect a degree of discomfort on every trip, but my goal is always the same: <b>JUST SIT THROUGH IT.</b> I've never tapped out on a session and I never will. I'm leaving with the piece I came for.
         <p>When I chose my career, I took my love of ink into account. I chose to be a System Administrator, forgoing any need to people please with my appearance.
